        Hi everyone! I'm Mritunjai and I'm currently studying in St.Judes Academy.
        My favorite subjects are both maths and science,and my favorite
        hobby is to code games but they have not become popular yet.
        Still I always keep working and trying my best because I want to become
        an entrepreneur so I can earn enough money from my game and jump start my business.

    <section id="whyIB">
        IB is more competitive than other schools with its rigorous program which will help me to achieve my goals
         and develop critical thinking, problem solving and communicating abilities which are needed for 
         developing my business   
        and also I get to work with people who have same passion as me.

    <section id="mygame">
        I created a game on roblox called Scary Monster. It's a game were you have to get into a car 
        to escape the Monsters and get a sword to kill them
        before they kill you.But the bad thing about my game is that
        the monsters kill each other and the weapons are too big. You can take a sneak peak at

        and I am into competitive swimming,

    <section id="contribution">
        I care about my friends and I will stand up for them and help them when they are stuck on some questions. 
        I love to communicate 
        with other people when we have group projects and present them to a wider audience.I need to improve
        on being an inquirer 
        and risk-taker. I am good in math,UOI and gym and need to improve on my language and music. I have 
        good problem solving capabilities and I can provide many ideas for developing a project.
        I created this website from scratch using html and css and I hope you like it.
